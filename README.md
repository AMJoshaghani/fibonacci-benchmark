The **Fibonacci Sequence** is a mathematical sequence solving the old *rabbit reproduction* puzzle.
Implementation of the sequence is important in programming in the manner of **Callback functions** concept having known its formula: F<sub>n</sub> = F<sub>n-1</sub> + F<sub>n-2</sub>.
As a result of the importance of Callback functions we focused on this concept and used the same logic for some of programming languages and made benchmark from their compiling/intrepretering speed.
